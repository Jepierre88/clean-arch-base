# üßπ Clean Architecture Base for React/Next.js

Welcome to a modern, scalable and maintainable boilerplate for React/Next.js projects, designed with Clean Architecture principles.

## üöÄ Why Clean Architecture?

Clean Architecture separates your code into clear layers (Domain, Use Cases, Infrastructure, Presentation), making your app:
- **Easy to test**
- **Highly maintainable**
- **Ready for growth and change**
- **Decoupled from frameworks and databases**

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

```
src/
	app/                # Next.js app entrypoints
	di/                 # Dependency injection setup
	domain/             # Pure business logic (entities, repositories, usecases)
	infraestructure/    # Data sources, repository implementations
	presentation/       # UI components
```

## üîÑ Example Flow

1. **Presentation**: UI triggers an action (e.g., fetch users)
2. **UseCase**: Business logic orchestrates the request
3. **Repository**: Abstracts data access
4. **Infrastructure**: Connects to real data sources
5. **DI Container**: Wires everything together

## üìù Quick Start

Clone, install and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tuusuario/clean-arch-base.git
cd clean-arch-base
npm install
npm run dev
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
